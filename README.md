Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! In this repository, I’ve built a site that showcases my projects, skills, and experiences. Below is an overview of the repository structure, an explanation of the MIT License choice, and some additional details about the project.

## Repository Files Overview

Here's a summary of the key files and directories included in my repository:

- **index.html**  
  This is the main HTML file that structures the content of my portfolio website. It serves as the entry point for visitors and sets up the basic layout and navigation.

  This directory contains all the assets I use throughout the website, organized into subdirectories:
  - **images/**  
    I store all images here, such as profile pictures, screenshots, and any other visuals that enhance the site’s presentation including the svg files for logos.
  - **css/**  
    This folder includes all the stylesheets that define the visual design of the site, ensuring a consistent and appealing look.

- **README.md**  
  You’re reading it now! It provides an overview of the project, its structure, and other important details.

## Why I Chose the MIT License

I chose the MIT License for my project because it is a permissive and straightforward open-source license. Here’s why it works for me:

- **Freedom to Use and Modify:**  
  The MIT License allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute my code, even for commercial purposes, as long as they include the original copyright notice and license.

- **Encouraging Collaboration:**  
  By using a permissive license, I want to promote collaboration within the developer community. I believe in sharing knowledge and making it easy for others to build on my work.

- **Simplicity:**  
  The MIT License is simple and easy to understand, which helps remove legal complexities and barriers for users and contributors alike.
